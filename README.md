# Employee_performance_tracker_Excel

I analyzed an employee performance dataset using Excel tools like PivotTables,XLOOKUP<VLOOKUO< and conditional formatting to turn raw data into meaningful insights.

Highlights from the analysis:

1.The company achieved 96% of its overall sales target.
#
2.HR and Marketing performed the strongest crossing their targets with 110% and 105% achievement.
#
3.Finance performed steadily at 94%, while Sales(90%) and IT(83%) showed potential areas for improvement.
#
4.Promotion eligibility was automated based on performance data to ensure accurate and consistent results.

This project shows how structured analysis and data visulization can help identify trends,evaluate performance, and support decision-making.
