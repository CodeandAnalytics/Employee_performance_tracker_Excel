I analyzed an employee performance dataset using Excel tools like PivotTables,XLOOKUP<VLOOKUO< and conditional formatting to turn raw data into meaningful insights.

## Highlights from the analysis:

1. The company achieved 96% of its overall sales target.

3. Finance performed steadily at 94%, while Sales (90%) and IT (83%) showed areas for improvement.
4. Promotion eligibility was automated using lookup formulas to ensure accurate and consistent results.
5. This project demonstrates how structured analysis and visualization can help identify trends and support decision-making.
